  <h1>🔰 Entry to Cybersecurity</h1>

  <blockquote>
    Ideal for: Beginners, Students, and Non-Tech Folks
  </blockquote>

  <h2>🧠 Understanding the Cybersecurity Landscape</h2>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity is all about <strong>protecting systems, networks, and data</strong> from digital threats. With everything becoming digital—from online banking to healthcare systems—cybersecurity plays a crucial role in keeping personal and organizational data safe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity isn’t just about “hacking” like in the movies. It’s a vast field made up of various roles like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Penetration Testers (Ethical Hackers)</strong> – simulate attacks to find weaknesses</li>
    <li><strong>Security Analysts</strong> – monitor systems for threats</li>
    <li><strong>Incident Responders</strong> – act when breaches happen</li>
    <li><strong>Governance & Compliance Experts</strong> – ensure companies follow security laws</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Security Specialists</strong> – secure cloud-based environments like AWS or Azure</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Skills Needed (Tech & Non-Tech)</h2>
  <p><strong>Technical Skills (learn slowly, no rush!):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic understanding of computers, networks (how the internet works)</li>
    <li>Operating Systems: Windows & Linux basics</li>
    <li>Familiarity with web apps and mobile apps</li>
    <li>Scripting (like Python) – helpful, not mandatory at first</li>
    <li>Using tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark (gradually)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Non-Technical Skills:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Curiosity and problem-solving mindset</li>
    <li>Good communication & documentation skills</li>
    <li>Ability to read, learn, and adapt quickly</li>
    <li>Logical thinking and pattern recognition</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 Free Resources to Get Started</h2>
  <p>No need to spend a lot of money initially. Here are solid free resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank">TryHackMe</a> – Interactive labs to learn by doing</li>
    <li>Hack The Box Academy – Beginner to pro content</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity Roadmap – Visual learning path</li>
    <li>PortSwigger Web Security Academy – Best for Web Security</li>
    <li>YouTube Channels: NetworkChuck, STÖK, The Cyber Mentor</li>
    <li>Books: "Cybersecurity for Beginners" by Raef Meeuwisse, "The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛣️ Career Paths & Domains</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity is not one-size-fits-all. Once you get the basics, you can choose from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming / Offensive Security</strong> – hacking and breaking into systems (legally)</li>
    <li><strong>Blue Teaming / Defensive Security</strong> – defending and monitoring systems</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Security</strong> – securing cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile & Web App Security</strong> – testing apps for vulnerabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Threat Hunting</strong> – proactively looking for threats in networks</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance & Audit</strong> – working with laws, policies, and standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything now. Pick an area that excites you and go deeper into that.</p>

  <h2>🧯 Busting Common Myths</h2>
  <blockquote>Let’s clear up a few things you might’ve heard:</blockquote>
  <div class="myth">❌ <em>You need to be a hacker from age 10</em> – Nope. Many people enter cybersecurity in their 20s, 30s, or even later.</div>
  <div class="myth">❌ <em>You must be great at coding</em> – Helpful, yes. Mandatory? Not always. You can start without it.</div>
  <div class="myth">❌ <em>Cybersecurity is only for Computer Science graduates</em> – Wrong. Anyone with a passion to learn can get into it.</div>
  <div class="myth">❌ <em>It's all about hacking into systems</em> – There’s so much more! Analysis, documentation, compliance, defense, cloud, and more.</div>
